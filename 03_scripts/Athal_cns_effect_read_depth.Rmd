## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

This document is to generate a set of graphs aimed at determining the effect of read depth on performance of my assembly pipeline

big idea is to have one dataframe with everything and a bunch of line graphs

I think the biggest pain will be creating the dataframe:
This is all for Ler-0 by the way

Rows:


Columns:
1.) Read number
  write out
2.) Read depth (normalized for A. thaliana)
  do math from first column
3.) Missing CNS #
  write out, wc -l
4.) Moved CNS #
  write out, wc -l
5.) Missing CNS overlap Can-0
  bash loop
6.) Moved CNS overlap Can-0
  bash loop
7.) # unambiguous bases
  bash loop
8.) # variants in 1st var_inc run
  grep -cv on whole directory write out
9.) # variants in 2nd var_inc run
10.) # variants in 3rd var_inc run
11.) % variants resolved with var_inc
  math from later columns
12.) prop. unmapped reads in 5th pbj round
  I think our final output does it? if not submit job for samtools flagstat



so going to make 12 different graphs

Write out vectors
